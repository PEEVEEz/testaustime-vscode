# testaustime-vscode

Official Testaustime VSCode extension.

## How to use?

You need to open the command palette `CTRL+SHIFT+P` and select `Testaustime: Set API key` and then enter your API key.

If you don't want to use the official server at `https://api.testaustime.fi`, you can use the `Testaustime: Set custom API endpoint` to use an unofficial server.
